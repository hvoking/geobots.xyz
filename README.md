# GeoBots.xyz - Geolocation Intelligence Embedded into Maps

An interactive web map showing snippets of the world at any location, with adjustable "boundaries" and the ability to toggle between a circle and actual walking distances using Mapbox isochrone API.

This project is open-source. All the code and interface is created from scratch with the fewest external libraries possible, and the objective is to be a base for AI applications.
